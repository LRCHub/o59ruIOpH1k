[00:20.79] Watching you get dressed messes with my head
[00:25.64] Take that bag off your shoulder
[00:30.23] Come get back in bed, we still got time left
[00:34.80] This don't have to be over
[00:38.53] And you say it's hard to keep a secret
[00:43.65] Girl, don't leave me all alone in this hotel
[00:48.04] And these shades can hide us from the streets, yeah
[00:52.86] One weekend I'll promise that I'll never tell
[00:57.17] You should probably stay, probably stay a couple more days
[01:02.48] Come on let me change your ticket home, oh
[01:06.98] You should probably stay here with me a couple more days
[01:11.36] Come on let me change your ticket home
[01:15.37] Don't go, it's not the same when you're gone
[01:20.95] And it's not good to be all alone
[01:24.13] So you should probably stay here with me a couple more days
[01:29.85] Come on let me change your ticket home
[01:34.48] Don't play innocent, I know what you meant
[01:39.28] When you said you'd come over
[01:43.93] Aren't we way past that, playing hard to get?
[01:48.48] We did that when we were younger
[01:52.52] And you say it's hard to keep a secret
[01:57.19] Girl, don't leave me all alone in this hotel
[02:01.68] And these shades can hide us from the streets, yeah
[02:06.91] One weekend I'll promise that I'll never tell
[02:10.84] You should probably stay, probably stay a couple more days
[02:15.91] Come on let me change your ticket home, oh
[02:20.65] You should probably stay here with me a couple more days
[02:25.11] Come on let me change your ticket home
[02:29.33] Don't go, it's not the same when you're gone
[02:34.40] And it's not good to be all alone (oh)
[02:37.64] Don't go, it's not the same when you're gone
[02:43.57] Come on let me change your ticket home (oh)
[02:48.45] Why don't we take some time?
[02:52.85] Why don't we take just a little more time?
[02:57.65] Why don't we make it right?
[03:01.86] Girl, I don't wanna say goodbye
[03:07.00] You should probably stay, probably stay a couple more days
[03:11.26] Come on let me change your ticket home, oh
[03:15.26] You should probably stay here with me a couple more days (a couple more days)
[03:20.57] Come on let me change your ticket home
[03:24.44] Don't go, it's not the same when you're gone
[03:29.65] And it's not good to be all alone
[03:32.91] Don't go (don't go), it's not the same when you're gone
[03:39.01] Come on let me change your ticket home
